# The project 100 pushups at once.
Inspired by: [Men's Health](https://www.menshealth.pl/fitness/Trening-100-pompek-w-6-tygodni,4629,1)

### I've done this as a first project while learning HTML, CSS and JS.
This is my first app, so I was using only pure HTML, CSS and JS.
The code was rewritten and I cut almost 50 lines of .js code o0. 

### Main knowledge from the project? 

"Think twice, code once"
